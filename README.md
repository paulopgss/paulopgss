# Paulo Sousa

Enthusiast of the best web & mobile development technologies.

I am passionate about all types of programming, from web to mobile, and I always seek to improve my learning, and to be always challenging myself and learning new things.
Since I fell in love and got to know this area of technology more, I never saw the world the same way again, and everything can be the basis for a great idea.
I am a very optimistic person with my plans and goals, and especially with the goals that I set myself, and the main one is always seeking to improve, to be better day after day, because that is my essence and what defines me. I like to keep myself informed and updated, and I always try to learn about what I don't know, and go even deeper into the things I already know. I love to stimulate my ability to solve problems and my creativity.

"Nothing in this world beats good old persistence. Talent does not surpass. Nothing more common than talented failures. Genius does not overcome. Unrecognized geniuses is practically a cliche. Education does not exceed. The world is full of educated fools. Persistence and determination alone are powerful."
